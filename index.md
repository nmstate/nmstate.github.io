# We are NMState!
A declarative network manager API for hosts.

## What is it?
NMState is a library with an accompanying command line tool that manages
host networking settings in a declarative manner.
The networking state is described by a pre-defined schema.
Reporting of current state and changes to it (desired state) both conform to
the schema.

NMState is aimed to satisfy enterprise needs to manage host networking through
a northbound declarative API and multi provider support on the southbound.
NetworkManager acts as the main (and currently the only) provider supported.

Visit the [examples page](./examples.md) to see what it can do.
